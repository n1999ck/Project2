Exploring Ruby for Programming Languages Class!

## Issues experienced:
I didn't run into many issues with this project. Ruby is overall an easy language to pick up. Two things I experienced:

1. When creating an else if statement, I had to look up the syntax to see that I needed to type 'elsif.'
2. When making code blocks - my else if and my while loop - I ran into errors around missing 'end' keywords.
