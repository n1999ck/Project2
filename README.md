More fun with Ruby, in the form of a simple word game.

Three elements I liked about using Ruby:
1. When I knew the syntax, things felt very efficient
2. I like how script-friendly the language feels
3. It was relatively easy to pick up

Three elements I disliked about using Ruby:
1. Learning syntax as I worked was difficult
2. Some syntax isn't very standard so I felt the need to look things up often
3. I'm used to more language support in IDEs, but couldn't find much for Ruby (yet)

Overall I think it will be worth experimenting more with Ruby.

The most important reference I used was probably https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/ , as it was a nice and concise reference for the basics.

Exploring Ruby for Programming Languages Class!

## Issues experienced:
I didn't run into many issues with this project. Ruby is overall an easy language to pick up. 

Two things I experienced:

1. When creating an else if statement, I had to look up the syntax to see that I needed to type 'elsif.'
2. When making code blocks - my else if and my while loop - I ran into errors around missing 'end' keywords.
